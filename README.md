Some projects related to my master's

Here you will find mostly Data-Decriptive or Data-Predictive Python codes. However, some R and SQL projects with the same purpose are also available.
Last but not least, I have done some optimization (CP and MIP) using Google OR-Tools.

All the work posted in this specific repository was developed by me and some coleagues.

I am a Brazilian mechanical engineering who is studying data science and engineering at Universidade do Porto, Portugal.
